UNotepad
========

This is an offline-capable multi-language-supported note pad which is based on [Notepad](https://notepad.js.org/).

With this online note pad, you don't have to install any input types in your computer. 
You can just write any words directly on this web page and download/copy them so that you can use them in your documents.

More languages are going to be added in.

## Features

  - Writes notes which are then saved to the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
  - Works and fetches notes offline-capable thanks to ServiceWorker.
  - "Add To Home Screen" feature on Android supported devices to launch the app from home screen.
  - Dark mode.
